# FlutterFromYaml

An experiment born out of a simple curious question: *What if you could build a screen in Flutter code using yaml?*

The answer? Well yes you can!

This project demonstrates how the default Flutter counter app can be generated from a YAML configuration file.

## How To Use
- Clone the project
- Open the project directory in your terminal
- Run the following command to generate the `main.dart` file

```dart
dart run lib/build.dart
```
- Run the app on your device
